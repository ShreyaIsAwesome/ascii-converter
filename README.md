# ASCII Converter

ASCII Converter is a simple yet powerful web application built with Python and Flask. It allows you to convert any image into a series of ASCII codes. Each character you type is translated into its corresponding symbolic ASCII value.

## How It Works

- You input an image and width
- The converter will first resize the image
- Then it will grayscale the resized image
- Finally, based on how dark/light the pixel is, a certain character is assigned
